In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:
A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.
A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.
A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag is 4.
